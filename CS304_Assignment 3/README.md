# Assignment 3 
## CS304 Data Structures 

### Description
This assignment involves implementing merge sort on a doubly linked list using the provided class _DoublyLinkedBase. Additionally, merge sort is implemented for Python lists for comparison. The sorting times of merge sort on both data structures are compared using Python's matplotlib plotting function.

### Requirements
Implement merge sort on a doubly linked list using the provided class _DoublyLinkedBase.
The merge sort function should accept an instance of type _DoublyLinkedBase.
Test the merge sort algorithm on a range of list sizes from 10 to 1000 in increments of 10 (n=10, n=20, n=30, ..., n=1000).
Implement merge sort for Python lists as well.
Compare the sorting times for merge sort on the doubly linked list vs Python lists for input sizes ranging from 10 to 1000.
Plot the comparison using matplotlib.

### Implementation Steps
Implement the provided class _DoublyLinkedBase for the doubly linked list.
Implement the merge sort algorithm for the doubly linked list using the provided class.
Create a function to generate a doubly linked list with random numbers.
Implement merge sort for Python lists.
Write a function to measure the sorting times for both data structures.
Plot the comparison using matplotlib.

### Running the Code
Install the required package matplotlib (pip install matplotlib).
Run the provided Python script.
The script will generate a comparison plot of sorting times for merge sort on the doubly linked list vs Python lists.
